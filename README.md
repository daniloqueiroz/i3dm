# About i3dm

i3dm is a set of tools/scripts for i3 that try to fill the gap from **wm** to a **de** -
hence it's 'a _desktop manager_: neither as simple as a wm, nor feature complete as a de.

It's based on existing tools from other DE, such LXDE and MATE.

# Requirements

It depends on the following archlinux packages:
 * rofi - for application launcher
 * feh - for wallpapers
 * compton - for window composition
 * lightlocker - for screen lock
 * dex - for .config/autostart/\*.desktop files
 * xsel -
 * xbacklight
 * pavucontrol
 * lxrandr
 * mate-polkit
